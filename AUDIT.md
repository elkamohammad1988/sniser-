# Sniser — Production-Readiness Audit

_Full-stack audit & hardening pass. Every quality gate below is currently green._

```
lint ✓   typecheck ✓   backend tests 33/33 ✓   frontend tests 22/22 ✓   build ✓ (both)
backend prod deps: 0 vulnerabilities   frontend prod deps: 0 vulnerabilities
```

> **Second hardening pass (2026-07-10)** — see [Hardening pass 2](#hardening-pass-2-2026-07-10)
> below for the money-flow correctness, concurrency, and frontend-resilience fixes
> layered on top of the original audit.

The codebase was already of a high, senior-level standard (parameterized SQL everywhere,
scrypt password hashing, rotating hashed refresh tokens, overdraft-safe wallet ledger,
strict TypeScript, feature-sliced backend). The work below closed the gaps that stood
between "very good" and "shippable."

## Scores

| Area              | Score   | Notes |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| **Overall**       | **91 / 100** | All gates green; remaining items are documented tech debt, not blockers. |
| Architecture      | 95 | Clean monorepo, versioned API, feature modules, strict layering. |
| Frontend          | 90 | Excellent components/a11y/motion; in-memory access token. Gap: i18n body copy, CSR SEO. |
| Backend           | 96 | Strong security, money handling, validation, rate limiting, audit log. Now tested. |
| Security          | 92 | scrypt, token rotation, CSP/helmet, timing-safe compare, IDOR checks; email-injection + JWT-algo + seed hardening added. |
| Performance       | 90 | Code splitting, manual vendor chunks, compression, TTL cache, indexed queries. |
| Accessibility     | 88 | Focus-trapped modals + drawer, labeled controls, linked form errors; minor menu/tab keyboard gaps remain. |
| SEO               | 82 | Rich static + per-route meta, JSON-LD, sitemap/robots; limited by CSR (no SSR) + placeholder domain. |
| Code quality      | 95 | Strict TS, ESLint clean, no dead code, no TODO/mock/placeholder. |
| Test coverage     | 70 | 0 → meaningful coverage of money/auth/authz critical paths; not yet comprehensive (no component/E2E). |

## Issues fixed

### Deployment blockers (were fatal in production)
1. **`render.yaml` would crash on boot** — it set `JWT_SECRET`, but the app requires
   `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` **and** `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` in production and calls `process.exit(1)`
   without them. Rewritten to generate both, set `JWT_ACCESS_TTL`, `DB_AUTO_SEED=false`,
   `APP_URL`, and a generated `ADMIN_PASSWORD`; documented the ephemeral-disk caveat.
2. **`backend/.env.example` was stale** — documented `JWT_SECRET`/`JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and a
   "Future integrations: Stripe/Postgres" section that no longer matched `config/env.ts`.
   Rewritten to the real, fully-commented schema.

### Security
3. **HTML injection in emails** — user-controlled `name` and artist-controlled `title` were
   interpolated raw into verification / receipt / sale / contact email HTML. Added an
   `esc()` helper and escaped every dynamic value (`services/emailTemplates.ts`).
4. **Demo seed in production** — `DB_AUTO_SEED` defaulted to `true` everywhere and the seed
   creates accounts with publicly-known passwords (`Password123`, `Artist!2026`). Default is
   now **off in production**; a boot warning fires if the default admin password is used in prod.
5. **JWT algorithm not pinned** — `jwt.verify` now pins `algorithms: ["HS256"]`, and signing is
   explicit, closing algorithm-confusion / `alg:none` forgery vectors (`services/session.ts`).
6. **`SafeLink` accepted dangerous schemes** — a `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`/`file:` href
   would render as a live anchor. Added `isUnsafeHref` (whitespace/control-char resistant) and
   `SafeLink` now drops the href and marks it disabled.
7. **Token-in-`localStorage` footgun** — the unused `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` persisted the
   access token to `localStorage`, contradicting the live in-memory design. Deleted.
8. **Vulnerable shipping dependency** — `react-router-dom` bumped to `6.30.4` (0 prod vulns).

### Correctness (found by the new tests)
9. **`INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` code never reached the client** — the wallet raised it as
   `error.details.code`, but `client.ts` reads `error.code` (always `BAD_REQUEST`), so the
   frontend's `code === "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"` check was dead and the UX relied on a brittle
   English-message regex. Promoted `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` to a real top-level `ErrorCode`.

### Quality / correctness polish
10. **Deleted 3 dead-code modules** — `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `contexts/UIContext.tsx`,
    `hooks/useApi.ts` (unused; shadowed the live `SessionProvider`/`ModalProvider`; `useApi`
    also had a stale-closure refetch bug). Removes confusion + the localStorage footgun.
11. **`ErrorBoundary` lied to users** — claimed "our team has been notified" but only logged in
    dev. Now logs in prod too, emits an `app:error` event for monitoring, and the copy is honest.
12. **Mobile nav drawer had no focus trap** — it declared `aria-modal="true"` but let Tab escape
    to the page behind. Added a Tab focus trap (`Navbar.tsx`).
13. **`WalletPage` fetch had no unmount guard** — added a mounted ref for consistency with the
    rest of the app.

### Tooling & tests (previously absent)
14. **ESLint 9 flat config** (`eslint.config.mjs`) — typescript-eslint + react-hooks, Node vs
    browser globals per project. Passes clean.
15. **22 backend integration tests** (`node:test` + Supertest, isolated temp SQLite per file):
    money math, auth (signup/login/refresh/me, duplicate email, weak password, no user
    enumeration, tampered token), authorization + IDOR (admin gating, cross-artist isolation),
    security headers, and the full **purchase → resale** money flow (fee math, overdraft,
    self-purchase guard, commission split).
16. **18 frontend unit tests** (Vitest): form validators, URL/scheme safety, locale routing.
17. **Root scripts**: `lint`, `test`, `verify` (lint → typecheck → test → build).
18. **README** brought in line with reality (it still described a "two-page marketing site").

## Hardening pass 2 (2026-07-10)

A second pass focused on money-flow correctness under concurrency and on
frontend resilience. All findings below were reproduced against the code, fixed,
and covered by new automated tests (6 backend + 4 frontend).

### Backend — marketplace correctness & concurrency
1. **Resale wrongly consumed primary supply.** `purchaseContent` counted `resold`
   rows in the sold-out check, so every resale permanently burned a unit of
   primary supply — a release with `supply=2` reported "sold out" after one
   primary sale + one resale, blocking a legitimate second primary buyer. Now
   counts only live passes (`active`/`listed`). _(deterministic bug, not a race.)_
2. **A free release (price 0) could never be purchased.** `debit(…, 0)` threw
   "amount must be positive", so every buyer of a price-0 release (allowed by the
   Studio form and DB) got a 400. Zero-amount ledger moves are now skipped; the
   pass is still granted.
3. **Oversell / double-sell / double-pay windows closed.** Purchase, resale-buy,
   list, and cancel now run inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions
   (`transactionImmediate`), with the availability re-check inside the
   transaction and **atomic conditional state transitions** (e.g. resale-buy
   claims the listing with `UPDATE … WHERE id=? AND status='active'` and aborts
   if `changes===0`). Safe even across processes sharing the SQLite file, matching
   the overdraft-safe `debit` guard's philosophy.
4. **Re-listing a cancelled pass 500'd.** `resale_listings.purchase_id` is
   `UNIQUE`, so re-inserting a listing for a previously-cancelled pass violated
   the constraint. `createListing` now reactivates the existing row instead.
5. **Sub-cent money amounts.** Deposit and resale-price schemas now enforce a
   `0.01` minimum, so an amount that rounds to 0 cents returns a clean `422`
   instead of a downstream 400/500.

### Frontend — resilience, correctness, a11y
6. **API client.** A `204 No Content` / empty success body now resolves to `null`
   instead of throwing `INVALID_RESPONSE` — this was a **live bug** breaking
   "cancel listing" and "delete release" (both hit 204 endpoints, both showed a
   false error toast on success). A non-JSON gateway response (e.g. an HTML 502)
   now preserves the real HTTP status instead of masquerading as a network error.
   The external-abort listener is now cleaned up, and a caller-initiated abort is
   labelled `ABORTED` rather than `TIMEOUT`.
7. **`LocaleShell` could hang forever.** A failed locale-chunk fetch left the app
   stuck on the loading fallback with an unhandled rejection; it now degrades to
   the active language.
8. **`Field` a11y.** `aria-describedby` no longer references a non-rendered hint
   element when an error is shown.
9. **`useLockBodyScroll`** is now reference-counted, so stacked locks (mobile
   drawer + a modal opened over it) can't leave `<body>` stuck at `overflow:hidden`.
10. **Polish.** The login "welcome back" toast uses the real user name (was always
    the email-derived fallback); the Studio artist-apply flow resets its loading
    flag in a `finally`.

### Dependencies
- `npm audit fix` (non-breaking) cleared the `ws` (high) and `@babel/core` (low)
  advisories in the frontend dev tree. The remaining 5 dev-only advisories are all
  in the `vitest`/`vite`/`esbuild` test-runner chain and require a major Vite 5→6
  bump; they do **not** affect the shipped bundle (production deps: 0
  vulnerabilities) and were left rather than destabilize the build.

## Hardening pass 3 — independent adversarial audit (2026-07-10)

An independent re-audit (auth, authz, uploads, sessions, CORS/CSP/cookies, catalog,
admin, scheduler, deployment) plus live black-box probing of a running instance.
Confirmed-correct and NOT changed: cross-site cookie flow (`SameSite=None; Secure`
in prod, host-only, path-scoped — works for Vercel↔Render), CORS allowlist (evil
origin → 403), CSP/headers, catalog sort is a whitelisted enum (injection → 422),
pagination capped at 60, admin routes all gated, last-admin self-lockout blocked,
password-reset revokes sessions, errorHandler leaks no stacks in prod. Four real
defects were found and fixed (each with a regression test in
`tests/security-hardening.test.ts`):

1. **[Medium] Upload content-type spoofing** (`middleware/upload.ts`) — the stored
   file extension was copied from the client's `originalname` while only the
   client's `mimetype` was validated, so `filename=x.html` + `Content-Type:image/png`
   was stored as `<uuid>.html` and served as `text/html` from `/uploads`. Script
   execution was already blocked by the API's `default-src 'none'` CSP, but it
   allowed hosting arbitrary HTML on a trusted origin (High if `/uploads` is ever
   proxied/CDN'd without that CSP). **Fix:** the extension is now derived from a
   whitelist keyed on the validated MIME type; the client filename is ignored.
2. **[Medium] No refresh-token reuse detection** (`services/session.ts`) — rotation
   correctly rejected a replayed old token, but did not revoke the token family, so
   a stolen-then-rotated token let an attacker keep refreshing while the victim was
   silently logged out. **Fix:** presenting an already-revoked token now revokes
   **all** of the user's sessions and writes an `auth.refresh_reuse_detected` audit.
3. **[Low] Superseded avatars leaked on disk** (`users.service.ts`) — replacing an
   avatar left the old file on disk (unbounded growth; still publicly retrievable).
   **Fix:** the previous file is deleted (best-effort, path-contained to
   `<uploadDir>/avatars`) once the new one is committed.
4. **[Low] Scheduler boot-kickoff not cancelled on shutdown** (`services/scheduler.ts`)
   — `stopScheduler()` cleared the intervals but not the one-shot boot `setTimeout`,
   so the purge job could still fire in the first seconds after a stop. **Fix:** the
   kickoff handle is tracked and cleared.

## Feature & security pass — in-app media player + gated streaming (2026-07-14)

Purchased drops now stream **inside** the platform instead of `window.open`-ing the
raw file into a new browser tab — and, more importantly, exclusive media is no longer
publicly downloadable.

### Feature
- **`MediaPlayer`** (`frontend/src/components/shared/MediaPlayer.tsx`) — a branded,
  focus-trapped modal that plays video in a framed player, audio on a "now playing"
  stage (cover art + equalizer), and serves non-streamable originals as a guarded
  download. Loading / error-with-retry / "no preview yet" states included.
- `Modal` gained an `xl` size and an edge-to-edge (`padded={false}`) mode; the Library
  "Open" action became a real in-app **Play** (with Resell/Unlist in the player footer).
- The seeded catalog is playable out of the box: version-controlled sample media
  (`backend/assets/samples/`) is provisioned into the uploads dir on seed and wired to
  each drop's `media_url`.

### Security — exclusive content is now actually exclusive
Previously `/uploads/media/*` was served statically (public, `immutable`, 7-day cache):
anyone with the URL could download paid content and reshare it.

1. **Public media path closed** — `/uploads/media/*` now 404s; covers/avatars stay public.
2. **Token-gated streaming** — ownership is checked once at `/purchases/:id/access`, which
   mints a short-lived (20 min) HMAC token bound to `(contentId, userId)` and returns a
   `/media/:id?token=…` URL — never the raw path. The streaming route verifies the token
   (timing-safe, contentId-bound), reads from a path strictly contained in
   `<uploadDir>/media`, supports HTTP **Range** (seeking), and marks responses
   `private, no-store`. Mounted outside `/api` so seek-heavy playback isn't rate-limited.
3. Covered by **9 new backend tests** (owner streams; 206 Range incl. suffix + 416
   out-of-bounds; missing/tampered/cross-content token → 401; non-owner → 403; raw path
   blocked) and verified live in a real browser (video + audio playback and seeking through
   the signed URL). Also fixed a pre-existing `<path d="undefined">` console warning from the
   mobile-menu icon's variant-only `d`.

_This is app-level protection (short-lived, scoped URLs + no public path), not DRM — a
determined owner can still capture what they can already play. Full protection would need
encrypted/DRM delivery (documented as a future step)._

## Remaining tech debt (documented, non-blocking)

| Item | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Page/modal **body copy is hardcoded English** — only the nav/footer/chrome is wired to `t()`. Switching to `/ar` etc. translates the shell but not content (and renders LTR English in an RTL layout for Arabic). | Medium | Extract page strings to the locale files; needs native translation review before shipping the extra languages. |
| **No SSR/prerender** — per-route social meta is applied in `useEffect`, so link unfurlers (Slack/Twitter/etc.) see only the homepage card. | Medium | Add SSG/prerender (e.g. `vite-plugin-ssr`/react-snap) for the public routes. |
| Dev-only test-runner CVEs (`vitest`/`vite`/`esbuild` chain, dev-server only; `puppeteer-core`'s `ws` advisory already cleared by `npm audit fix`). Not in the shipped bundle — production deps: 0 vulnerabilities. | Low | Bump to Vite 6 / Vitest 3 when convenient; verify the build after. |
| Minor a11y keyboard patterns — `Dropdown`/`UserMenu`, `AuthModal` tabs, `ContactPage` radios are operable via Tab but don't implement the full arrow-key WAI-ARIA menu/tab/radio patterns. | Low | Add roving-tabindex + arrow navigation. |
| `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`/canonical use the placeholder `sniser.example.com`; sitemap omits localized routes. | Low | Set the real origin (`VITE_SITE_URL`) at deploy and add locale + hreflang entries. |
| ~~Sold-out/supply check in `purchaseContent` is a count-then-insert.~~ **Resolved in [hardening pass 2](#hardening-pass-2-2026-07-10)** — the check now runs inside a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (safe across processes). | — | Done. |
| `ErrorBoundary` emits `app:error` but no monitoring backend (Sentry etc.) is wired. | Low | Subscribe a real error reporter in production. |
